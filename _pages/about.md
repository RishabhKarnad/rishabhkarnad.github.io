I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad, while working as a Research Assistant under Dr. Srijith P.K. My research interests include Causal Learning, Bayesian Learning, Climate Change and AI for Good. I have previously worked as a software developer and have over 4 years of experience working on web and mobile applications.
